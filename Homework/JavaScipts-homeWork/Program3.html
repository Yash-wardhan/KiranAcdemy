        Question. WAP to check the given number is divisible by 5 and 3
    </p>
    <script>
        // As we know 5 and 3 divisiblity 
        // 5 at Any number end with  5 and 0
        // 3 at Any number is  3 and 9 is divisible any number is also divisible by 3
        // and Take LCM (5 and 3) = 15
        var n1 = parseInt(prompt("Enter Your Number:"))

        //cal only 15 take reminder is zero then it also divisible 3 and 5

        if(n1%15 ==0){
            alert(`${n1} is divisible by 3 and 5`)
        }
        else{
            alert(`${n1} is not divisible by 3 and 5`)
        }
